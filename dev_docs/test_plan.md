# Test Plan

This document outlines the test-driven development (TDD) approach for the GenAI Newsletter-Driven Repository Curator project.

## Testing Philosophy

1. Write tests first, then implement code
2. Each feature must have comprehensive test coverage
3. Tests should be independent and repeatable
4. Mock external services to ensure reliable testing
5. Regular test suite execution in CI/CD pipeline

## Test Implementation Guidelines

### Test Structure
```python
# Example test structure
def test_newsletter_processing():
    # Arrange
    newsletter = create_test_newsletter()
    
    # Act
    result = process_newsletter(newsletter)
    
    # Assert
    assert result.repositories_found > 0
    assert result.categories_updated
    assert result.processing_status == 'completed'

# Vector storage test example
def test_content_relationships():
    # Arrange
    newsletter = create_test_newsletter()
    repository = create_test_repository()
    
    # Act
    storage.add_relationship(newsletter, repository, "mentions")
    
    # Assert
    assert storage.get_related_content(newsletter, "mentions") == [repository]
```

### Mocking Strategy
```python
# Example mock setup
@pytest.fixture
def mock_gmail_api():
    with patch('gmail.api.client') as mock_client:
        mock_client.get_messages.return_value = [
            create_test_message()
        ]
        yield mock_client

def test_gmail_integration(mock_gmail_api):
    result = fetch_newsletters()
    assert len(result) > 0
    mock_gmail_api.get_messages.assert_called_once()
```

### Test Data Management
- Use fixtures for common test data
- Implement data factories for complex objects
- Clean up test data after each test
- Use separate test database

## Continuous Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow
```yaml
name: Test Suite
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
      - name: Run tests
        run: pytest --cov
```
