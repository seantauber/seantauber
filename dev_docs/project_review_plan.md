# Project Review Plan

## Objective
Analyze the current state of the project to:
1. Identify the latest working implementation in component tests
2. Compare with current production pipeline
3. Document gaps and outdated components
4. Create plan for implementing production pipeline

## Review Steps

### 1. Component Tests Analysis [ ]
- [ ] Identify all component test files
- [ ] Document the pipeline flow in component tests
- [ ] List all dependencies and configurations used
- [ ] Map data flow between components
- [ ] Note any recent changes or removals (e.g. curator component)

### 2. Production Code Analysis [ ]
- [ ] Review current production scripts
- [ ] Identify outdated implementations
- [ ] Document missing functionality
- [ ] List configuration differences
- [ ] Note any deprecated components still in use

### 3. Database and Infrastructure [ ]
- [ ] Review database schema and migrations
- [ ] Check configuration files
- [ ] Analyze environment requirements
- [ ] Document infrastructure dependencies

### 4. Test Coverage Analysis [ ]
- [ ] List all test files
- [ ] Identify outdated tests
- [ ] Map test dependencies
- [ ] Note test configuration differences

### 5. Documentation Review [ ]
- [ ] Review all documentation files
- [ ] Identify outdated documentation
- [ ] List missing documentation
- [ ] Note configuration documentation status
