# Project Status Overview

## Current State

The project has working components demonstrated in component tests, but lacks a production pipeline implementation. The component tests represent the most up-to-date and functional code.

### Working Components
1. Gmail/Newsletter Processing
2. Content Extraction
3. README Generation

### Key Files (Current Implementation)
- Component Tests in tests/components/
- Core Agents in agents/
- Processing modules in processing/
- Database infrastructure in db/

## Action Items

### 1. Cleanup (see cleanup_plan.md)
- Remove outdated files
- Update configurations
- Clean up documentation

### 2. Production Implementation (see production_implementation_plan.md)
- Create pipeline runner
- Set up configurations
- Implement monitoring

### 3. Documentation (see project_review_findings.md)
- Update setup guide
- Create deployment docs
- Update architecture docs

## Next Steps

1. Follow cleanup_plan.md to remove outdated code
2. Implement production pipeline following production_implementation_plan.md
3. Update documentation based on project_review_findings.md

## Notes

- Component tests should be considered the source of truth
- All development should align with working component implementations
- Maintain tests as reference until production pipeline is verified

See individual documents for detailed plans:
- project_review_findings.md
- cleanup_plan.md
- production_implementation_plan.md
