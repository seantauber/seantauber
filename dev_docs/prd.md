# GitHub GenAI List Project PRD

## Overview
Refactor the existing GitHub GenAI List project to use the CrewAI framework for better agent orchestration and task management.

## Goals
1. Migrate existing agent-based architecture to CrewAI framework
2. Implement role-based agents using CrewAI's agent system
3. Define clear tasks and processes for agents
4. Maintain existing functionality while improving code organization
5. Enable better collaboration between agents

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. Agent System
   - Define specialized agents with clear roles and responsibilities
   - Implement agent backstories and goals
   - Enable inter-agent communication and delegation

2. Task Management
   - Define clear tasks for updating and maintaining the GenAI list
   - Implement task dependencies and workflows
   - Enable task output validation

3. Process Flow
   - Use CrewAI's sequential process for ordered task execution
   - Implement proper error handling and recovery
   - Enable task result persistence

### Technical Requirements

1. Configuration
   - Create agents.yaml for agent definitions
   - Create tasks.yaml for task definitions
   - Implement crew.py for orchestration

2. Integration
   - Maintain compatibility with existing models
   - Preserve current API endpoints and interfaces
   - Ensure backward compatibility where possible

3. Testing
   - Update test suite for CrewAI compatibility
   - Add new tests for CrewAI-specific features
   - Maintain test coverage standards

## Success Metrics
1. Successful execution of all existing functionality
2. Improved code organization and maintainability
3. Enhanced agent collaboration capabilities
4. Maintained or improved performance metrics
5. Comprehensive test coverage

## Timeline
1. Phase 1: Setup and Configuration (1-2 days)
   - Create PRD and Kanban
   - Setup CrewAI configuration files
   - Define initial agent roles

2. Phase 2: Implementation (2-3 days)
   - Create agents.yaml
   - Create tasks.yaml
   - Implement crew.py

3. Phase 3: Testing and Refinement (1-2 days)
   - Update test suite
   - Test all functionality
   - Refine and optimize

## Future Considerations
1. Potential expansion to hierarchical processes
2. Integration of additional CrewAI features
3. Performance optimization opportunities
4. Enhanced monitoring and logging capabilities
