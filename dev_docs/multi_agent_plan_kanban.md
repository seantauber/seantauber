## Current Priority: Integration Testing
Status: üèóÔ∏è
Description: Implement and verify integration tests with real API calls

#### Tasks
1. Setup Integration Test Environment

     * [x] Set up LLM API access for testing
     * [x] Create test configuration file

2. Implement Core Integration Tests
   - Status: üèóÔ∏è
   - Priority: High
   - Subtasks:
     * [x] Test GitHub repository fetching
     * [x] Test LLM-based categorization
     * [x] Test consensus generation
     * [x] Create test README output
     * [x] Fix test assertions to handle dynamic content
     * [ ] Improve categorization to reduce "Other" section
     * [ ] Filter out empty/incomplete repo entries
     * [ ] Update test scope documentation

3. Standardize Agent Communication
   - Status: üÜï NEW
   - Priority: High
   - Description: Implement structured output using Pydantic for all agent communication
   - Dependencies: None
   - Subtasks:
     * [ ] Create communication models for each agent type
     * [ ] Update agents to use structured input/output
     * [ ] Add validation for inter-agent messages
     * [ ] Update tests to verify structured communication
     * [ ] Document communication protocol
   - Notes:
     * Will help prevent type mismatches and validation errors
     * Should include clear enum definitions for categorical fields
     * Need to ensure OpenAI schema compatibility
     * Consider creating base communication model class

4. End-to-End System Verification
   - Status: üö´ BLOCKED
   - Priority: High
   - Dependencies: Task 2
   - Subtasks:
     * [ ] Test complete workflow with real APIs
     * [ ] Verify README generation
     * [ ] Document test results

### Issues Found
1. Test Assertions
   - README content is dynamically generated, making exact string matching unreliable
   - Current assertion failing: `assert "Editor's Note" in content`
   - Need to implement more flexible assertions that verify structure rather than exact content
   - Consider using regex or structural checks instead of exact string matching

2. Categorization Issues
   - Too many repos ending up in "Other" category
   - "Other" should be reserved for non-AI/ML/data science repos
   - Need to improve categorization logic in consensus system
   - ConsensusManager may need updates to better handle AI/ML categorization

3. Empty Entries
   - Empty repo entries being included in output
   - Need to add validation to filter out incomplete entries
   - Update repo formatting to skip entries with missing critical data

### Test Implementation Notes
1. Test Scope
   - Using only 2 repos for testing to improve speed
   - May need to increase test coverage later while maintaining performance
   - Consider parameterized tests for different repo counts

2. Test Data Management
   - Using main README.md as template for test_readme_output.md
   - Ensures test environment matches production structure
   - Need to handle dynamic content in assertions

3. Consensus System Integration
   - Current categorization logic needs refinement
   - Consider adding specific rules for AI/ML/data science categorization
   - May need to update ConsensusManager to better handle topic hierarchies
