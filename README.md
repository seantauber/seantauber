## üîß Implementation Details

### Architecture Overview

The **GitHub Starred Repositories Tracker** employs a **multi-agent system** powered by OpenAI's GPT-4 model with **Structured Outputs**. This architecture ensures that each component of the workflow operates efficiently and reliably, maintaining the integrity and organization of your `README.md`.

### Multi-Agent System

The system is composed of the following specialized agents:

1. **Triaging Agent**
   - **Role:** Acts as the coordinator, assessing tasks and delegating them to appropriate agents.
   - **Responsibilities:**
     - Evaluate incoming tasks or update triggers.
     - Delegate tasks to specialized agents based on the nature of the update.

2. **Fetching Agent**
   - **Role:** Retrieves your starred repositories from the GitHub API.
   - **Responsibilities:**
     - Fetch the latest list of starred repositories.
     - Ensure data integrity and handle API interactions.

3. **Processing Agent**
   - **Role:** Cleans and enriches the fetched repository data.
   - **Responsibilities:**
     - Remove duplicates and handle missing values.
     - Calculate metrics such as star growth rate and activity level.

4. **Curation Agent**
   - **Role:** Assigns tags and scores to repositories.
   - **Responsibilities:**
     - Categorize repositories based on relevance and topics.
     - Calculate popularity and trending scores to prioritize listings.

5. **Editor Agent**
   - **Role:** Aligns new repositories with the existing README structure.
   - **Responsibilities:**
     - Merge new curated data with existing entries.
     - Maintain consistency in categorization and tagging.
     - Generate editor's notes explaining changes and decisions.

6. **ReadmeUpdater Agent**
   - **Role:** Updates the `README.md` with the latest repository information.
   - **Responsibilities:**
     - Insert or update repository sections in the README.
     - Update the table of contents to reflect new categories.
     - Append links to archived editor notes.

7. **Archive Agent**
   - **Role:** Maintains a historical log of editor summaries.
   - **Responsibilities:**
     - Archive each editor's note with timestamps.
     - Provide a historical reference for changes made over time.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**
- **GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT):** Required to access the GitHub API.
- **OpenAI API Key:** Needed to utilize OpenAI's GPT-4 model.

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/seantauber/starred-repos-tracker.git
cd starred-repos-tracker
```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. **Install Dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Configure Environment Variables**

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following content:

```env
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_personal_access_token
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

Security Note: Ensure that the `.env` file is added to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits of sensitive information.

5. **Initialize the Agents**

The agents are modular and can be extended with additional capabilities as needed. By default, they come with predefined functionalities tailored to this project.

### Usage
To update your `README.md` with the latest starred repositories, execute the main script:

```bash
python update_readme.py`
```

This script orchestrates the multi-agent workflow:

1. Triaging Agent assesses the update task.
2. Fetching Agent retrieves your starred repositories.
3. Processing Agent cleans and enriches the data.
4. Curation Agent categorizes and scores the repositories.
5. Editor Agent aligns new data with the existing README.
6. ReadmeUpdater Agent updates the README.md.
7. Archive Agent logs the editor's notes for historical reference.

### Customization

The system is designed for extensibility. You can initialize agents with additional capabilities or modify existing ones to suit your specific needs. Refer to the [Developer Guide](docs/developer_guide.md) for detailed instructions on extending and customizing the agents.
