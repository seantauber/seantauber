## How This Landing Page Works

This GitHub landing page is dynamically updated to showcase my latest interests and discoveries in the fields of AI, Machine Learning, and Data Science. Here's how it works:

1. **Automated Updates**: The repository list you see above is automatically updated daily using GitHub Actions.

2. **Starred Repositories**: The content is based on my GitHub starred repositories, reflecting my current interests and valuable finds in the tech world.

3. **AI-Powered Organization**: An AI model (GPT-3.5-turbo) is used to categorize and organize the repositories, ensuring that the list remains well-structured and informative.

4. **Minimal Manual Intervention**: Once set up, this page requires little to no manual updating, keeping the content fresh with minimal effort.

### How to Implement This for Your Own GitHub

If you'd like to create a similar landing page for your GitHub profile:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Set up the following secrets in your forked repository's settings:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key
   - `PAT`: A GitHub Personal Access Token with appropriate permissions
3. Update the `update_readme.py` script in the `.github/scripts/` directory:
   - Replace `"YourGitHubUsername"` with your actual GitHub username
4. Customize the README.md template to fit your personal brand and interests.
5. The GitHub Action will run daily, updating your README with your latest starred repositories.

Feel free to modify the script or the README structure to better suit your needs. Happy showcasing!
