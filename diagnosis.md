# Content Extraction Component Debug Task

## Background Context

Recent work has focused on fixing issues in the content extraction component:

1. Fixed database transaction conflicts during parallel repository processing:
   - Modified store_repository_data() to use a single transaction
   - Made repository, topic, and category inserts atomic

2. Fixed coroutine error in task argument access:
   - Modified process_newsletter_content() to track URLs alongside tasks
   - Removed problematic task._args[0] access

3. Attempted to fix async_generator fixture issue:
   - Removed incorrect `await anext(content_extractor)` usage
   - Updated code to use fixture directly
   - Fixed variable name consistency in batch processing
   - Added safety check for github_client cleanup

## New Issues Discovered

After implementing these changes, running the tests reveals a persistent issue:

```
FAILED tests/components/test_content_extraction.py::TestContentExtractionComponent::test_repository_extraction
AttributeError: 'async_generator' object has no attribute 'process_newsletter_content'
```

Key details from the error:
1. Location: process_newsletter_batch method
2. Error occurs when trying to call process_newsletter_content on the extractor
3. The extractor is still an async_generator despite our fixes
4. Test successfully finds and splits newsletters into batches before failing

Additional context:
- Test finds 10 newsletters to process
- Successfully splits into 4 batches of size 3
- Failure occurs during the concurrent processing of these batches
- The content_extractor fixture is still yielding an async_generator instead of resolving to a ContentExtractorAgent instance

## Investigation Steps Needed

1. Examine pytest-asyncio configuration:
   - Check if the async fixture is properly configured
   - Verify pytest-asyncio mode settings
   - Review any potential conflicts with other pytest plugins

2. Review fixture resolution:
   - Analyze how the content_extractor fixture is being resolved
   - Check if the async context manager is properly entered
   - Verify the fixture chain (setup_database -> content_extractor)

3. Inspect ContentExtractorAgent implementation:
   - Verify async context manager protocol implementation
   - Check for any issues in __aenter__ and __aexit__ methods
   - Review initialization sequence

4. Examine test execution flow:
   - Analyze how the fixture is passed to process_newsletter_batch
   - Review the batch processing implementation
   - Check for any async/await misuse

The goal is to understand why the fixture is not properly resolving to a ContentExtractorAgent instance despite our previous fixes.
